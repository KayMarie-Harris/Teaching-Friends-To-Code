Tree: a data structure in which data items are connected using references in a hierarchical manner in the form of 
        edges and nodes

Child Node: Child nodes of a parent node are the nodes at which the parent node is pointing using the references. 

Edge: The reference through which a parent node is connected to a child node is called an edge

Leaf Node: These are those nodes in the tree that have no children

Internal Nodes: Internal Nodes are the nodes that have at least one child

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node can have a maximum of 2 children.  
    It means that each node in a binary tree can have either one, or two or no children
