Lists Vs Arrays:

    Lists:
        - not fixed in size
        - can store various data types at the same time
        - built in data structure in python
    Arrays:
        - fixed in size
        - can store only ONE same single data type at a time
        - not built in, must import 
        - more compact and mem efficient



    Both: mutable ordered sequence of elements
