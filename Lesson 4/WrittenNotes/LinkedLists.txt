    Linked List - a linear data structure that has a collection of nodes that are linked with each other
    # Draw visualization
    uses next() points to the next item in the list


Advantages:
    Frequent Insertions and Deletions in Middle: If your application involves frequent insertion or deletion of elements 
    in the middle of the list, linked lists can outperform arrays, as inserting or deleting elements in an array requires 
    shifting all the elements after the insertion or deletion point.

    Can represent circular data
