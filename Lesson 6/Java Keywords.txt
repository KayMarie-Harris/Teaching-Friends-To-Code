Access Modifiers

In Java, access modifiers are keywords used to define the visibility or accessibility of classes, methods, variables,
and constructors within a program.

There are four different types of modifiers:

    1. Public - Members declared as public are accessible from any class. They have the widest scope and can be
                accessed from any class or package.
    2. Protected - Members declared as protected are accessible within the same package and by subclasses
                   outside the package.
    3. Private - Members declared as private are accessible only within the same class. They are not visible to any
                 other class, even subclasses.
    4. Default - if you do not specify an access modifier, it defaults to package-private. Members with default access
                 are accessible only within the same package.


What does static mean?

    static is a keyword in Java used to create variables and methods that belong to the class itself,
    rather than to instances of the class


What is void?

    void is a keyword used in Java to declare that a method does not return any value. When a method has a return type
    of void, it means the method performs a task but does not produce a result that can be used in expressions.
    void methods are often used for actions or operations that do not need to return a value.
