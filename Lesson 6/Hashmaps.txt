A HashMap in Java is a data structure that implements the Map (Maps are also known as dictionaries) interface and provides key-value pairs storage.
 It allows you to store and retrieve objects based on keys and is particularly useful when you need fast access to
 data and you want to associate one piece of data (the "value") with another (the "key").

Key Features of HashMap:
Key-Value Pairs:

HashMap stores data in key-value pairs. Each key is associated with a specific value.
Fast Retrieval:

HashMap provides constant-time performance for basic operations (get and put) in the average case, making it efficient for large datasets.
Unordered Collection:

HashMap does not guarantee the order of elements. If you need to maintain insertion order, you can use LinkedHashMap, a variation of HashMap that preserves the order of elements.
Null Keys and Values:

HashMap allows null values and one null key. This means you can have key-value pairs where the key or the value (or both) is null.
