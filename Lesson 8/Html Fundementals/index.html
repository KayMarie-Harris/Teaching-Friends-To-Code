            </div>
            <p>
                I started streaming when I was a freshman in
                college and it was one of the best decisions
                I've made to this day. I am extreamly privledged to
                have cultivated an online community to connect with
                viewers around the world. I stream to a follower base of
                over 250 people and am still growing.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've put in a lot of work creating content and analyzing data to
                be the best streamer I can for my community. I am proud of how far I've come
                and I'm excited to see where the journey takes me.

            <p>
                Hardware absolutly facinates me, which is why I got
                into building PC's. I've only build two so far, but I love
                learning about new builds and parts. Occassionally I'll takes
                my PC apart just so I can build it again!

            <p> While I hope to turn coding into a career I also
                consider it to be a hobby! I am passionate about coding
                and love to share it with anyone who wants to learn.

                A friend recently asked me to teach them how to code,
                so that's what I'm doing. I have prepared lessons plans
                to teach them everything I know and I'm having lots of
                fun with it!
