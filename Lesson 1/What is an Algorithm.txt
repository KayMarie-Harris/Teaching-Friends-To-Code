Algorithm: A step-by-step set of instructions for solving a problem
    ex:  cooking recipie 


Coding is essentially breaking down a big problem into smaller steps
     -> breaking it down into algorithms

Pseudocode: uses plain language to break down a problem into steps
     -> used to plan & outline an algorithm
     -> Ex: the Pseudocode for the "algorithm" to make a sandwich would look like so:
            1. get two slices of bread
            2. get a jar of peanut butter
            3. get a jar of jelly
            4. get a butter knife
            5. open the peanut butter jar and put some on the knife
            6. spread peanut butter on one side of a slice of bread
            .
            .
            .
            etc.
